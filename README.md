# Challenge1

My product name is MyDiary.

MyDiary is a website which will help users to create their own diaries.A diary is a record with descrete entries arranged by date repoting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and /or feelings.

In challenge 1, I have worked on front end where I have designed user interface.User should be able to register,login,create their entries or diaries, view all entries,view specific entries and modify their entries.I have hosted on github.


In challenge 2,I have worked on backend.I have created different endpoints like get all entries,get a specific entry,add new entry, delete entry and update entry. Also I have created test of all endpoints.I have hosted endpoints on heroku.
